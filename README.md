## DISCRIPTION OF PROJECT:

**Task: TO CONDUCT SECURITY TESTING TO IDENTIFY VULNERABILITIES LIKE SQL INJECTION OR XSS IN A SAMPLE WEB APPLICATION.**

**Security testing with SQL Injection**

To perform this acction I used a open-source project (https://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp).
In this project on the login page I try to login without valid credentiols and the result was fail I was not able to login the application,
but with the SQL injection (" OR 1=1--) I was able to login the application as admin.

**Setup Testing Environment**
Before testing, I ensure that I have:

A test web application (like DVWA, Mutillidae, or a custom-built vulnerable app).
A security testing tool (Burp Suite).
A web browser with developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools).

**Test for SQL Injection (SQLi)**

As I already know that SQL Injection occurs when an attacker manipulates SQL queries via input fields.

Basically there was login input field, in which I use " OR 1=1-- SQL injection attack and it was successful.
And then I try to enter SQL payloads like:
' OR '1'='1  -- 
" OR "1"="1" -- 
admin' -- 

And it was a success with each one. And then the database returns sensitive information or bypasses authentication, it was vulnerable.

**Preventive Measures**
Encode and escape user input (use HTML entities).
Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
Use frameworks like React or Angular, which auto-escape data.

**Final Report**
The web application was vulnerable to SQL attack

**Security testing with OWASP ZAP**


Amazon ZAP Security Report - Summary
This security report, generated by ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) version 2.16.0, provides an analysis of potential vulnerabilities for multiple websites, including Amazon, Google, and GitHub domains. The report categorizes security risks based on their severity: High, Medium, Low, and Informational.

Summary of Alerts
The report identifies the following risk levels:

Medium Risk: 1 alert
Low Risk: 3 alerts
Informational: 1 alert
No high-risk vulnerabilities were detected.

Identified Security Issues
1. Cross-Domain Misconfiguration (Medium Risk)
This issue is related to improper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration. The web server allows cross-domain resource access from arbitrary third-party domains without proper authentication. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

Affected URL: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/...
Attack Method: GET and POST requests
Solution: The server should restrict CORS to trusted domains and properly configure the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.
2. Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header Field (Low Risk)
The server response header exposes version details, which can help attackers identify vulnerabilities specific to the application.

Affected URL: https://plausible.io/js/script.js
Attack Method: POST request
Solution: The server should be configured to suppress the "Server" header or provide generic details to avoid information leakage.
3. Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set (Low Risk)
The server does not enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which prevents users from accessing the site over insecure HTTP connections.

Affected URL: https://plausible.io/js/script.js
Attack Method: POST request
Solution: The server should enforce HSTS by setting the appropriate HTTP header to ensure all connections occur over HTTPS.
4. X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing (Low Risk)
The server does not set the X-Content-Type-Options header to "nosniff", allowing older browsers to perform MIME-sniffing, which can lead to security risks.

Affected URL: https://plausible.io/js/script.js
Attack Method: POST request
Solution: The application should correctly set the Content-Type header and configure the X-Content-Type-Options to "nosniff" for all web pages.
5. Re-examine Cache-Control Directives (Informational)
The cache-control headers are either missing or not properly set, which may allow browsers and proxies to cache sensitive content.

Affected URL: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/...
Attack Method: GET request
Solution: Set proper cache-control directives such as "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" to prevent unintended caching of sensitive content.
Conclusion
The report highlights a mix of configuration weaknesses and missing security headers that can expose web applications to potential attacks. While no high-risk vulnerabilities were detected, the CORS misconfiguration poses a medium-level risk, which should be addressed immediately. Additionally, implementing HSTS, suppressing server version headers, and ensuring proper cache and content security policies will strengthen overall web security.
